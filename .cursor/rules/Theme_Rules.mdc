# Theme Guidelines

This document defines the visual theme for our application. It outlines the design principles, color palette, typography, and overall aesthetics inspired by our reference (e.g., Contently's clean and modern approach).

## Visual Style

- **Clean & Modern:**  
  - Emphasize ample white space, minimal clutter, and a focus on clear, concise presentation.
  - Use high-quality imagery and well-considered layouts that guide the user's attention naturally.

- **Consistent Branding:**  
  - Establish a consistent visual language that aligns with our brand identity.
  - Incorporate our chosen brand accent colors throughout the UI, ensuring that call-to-action (CTA) elements and interactive components stand out.

## Color Palette

- **Neutral Base:**  
  - Primary backgrounds and content areas should use neutral colors (whites, light grays) to create a clean canvas.
- **Accent Colors:**  
  - Use bold and contrasting colors for CTAs, links, and key interactive elements.
  - Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility.

## Typography

- **Headlines:**  
  - Use large, bold sans-serif fonts for headlines to ensure clarity and emphasis.
- **Body Text:**  
  - Employ a readable sans-serif or modern serif font for body copy.
  - Maintain consistent line heights and spacing for readability.
- **Hierarchy:**  
  - Establish a clear typographic hierarchy (e.g., H1, H2, H3, etc.) to organize information logically.

## Imagery & Iconography

- **High-Quality Imagery:**  
  - Use professional photography or custom illustrations that support the content.
- **Icons:**  
  - Utilize a consistent icon set that is modern, simple, and aligns with the overall design language.
  - Icons should be used to reinforce functionality and aid in navigation.

## Layout & Spacing

- **Grid System:**  
  - Follow a responsive grid layout, leveraging Bootstrapâ€™s grid system to ensure consistency across devices.
- **Spacing:**  
  - Use generous margins and paddings to prevent overcrowding.
  - Maintain consistency in spacing across similar components.

## Design Principles

- **Simplicity:**  
  - Prioritize a straightforward, intuitive design that minimizes cognitive load.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Ensure all color contrasts, font sizes, and interactive elements meet accessibility standards (WCAG).
- **Consistency:**  
  - Keep design elements consistent throughout the application to build familiarity and ease-of-use.
- **Feedback:**  
  - Provide clear visual feedback on interactions (e.g., hover states, active states) to guide user behavior.
