# Tech Stack Rules and Best Practices

This document references our finalized choices in [tech-stack.md](mdc:docs/project-info/tech-stack.md) and outlines the best practices, limitations, conventions, and important considerations for our selected technology stack. It is intended as a reference for developers to ensure consistency, maintainability, and high-quality implementation throughout the project.

## 1. Frontend: React with TypeScript

### Best Practices
- **Component Structure:**  
  - Organize components by feature rather than by type.  
  - Keep components small, focused, and reusable.
- **Type Safety:**  
  - Utilize TypeScript for static type checking.  
  - Define and maintain clear interfaces and types for props, state, and API responses.
- **State Management:**  
  - Use React's Context API or state management libraries (like Redux) where necessary.  
  - Keep local component state minimal and prefer lifting state up only when needed.
- **Code Organization:**  
  - Follow a consistent folder structure (e.g., components, hooks, services, assets).  
  - Maintain separation of concerns (UI components vs. business logic).
- **Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests using frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.  
  - Focus on testing component behavior and integration rather than implementation details.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Complexity Overhead:**  
  - Overusing TypeScript can sometimes slow development if type definitions become too complex.
- **Performance:**  
  - Watch for unnecessary re-renders; use `React.memo` and hooks like `useCallback` or `useMemo` to optimize performance.
- **Tooling & Config:**  
  - Ensure that your build tools (Webpack, Babel, etc.) are configured to support TypeScript and handle module resolution cleanly.

## 2. Backend/API: AWS Lambda with API Gateway

### Best Practices
- **Function Design:**  
  - Keep Lambda functions single-purpose and stateless.  
  - Use microservices architecture to break down functionality.
- **API Design:**  
  - Follow RESTful or event-driven design patterns as appropriate.  
  - Use proper HTTP status codes and error messages.
- **Deployment & Monitoring:**  
  - Leverage AWS Amplify for streamlined deployment.  
  - Use CloudWatch for logging and performance monitoring.
- **Security:**  
  - Apply least privilege principles using IAM roles.  
  - Validate all input to prevent injection attacks.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Cold Starts:**  
  - Be aware of cold start delays in Lambda functions; consider using provisioned concurrency if latency is critical.
- **Execution Time:**  
  - Lambda functions have a maximum execution time (currently 15 minutes). Ensure that tasks fit within this limit or are split into smaller functions.
- **Resource Limits:**  
  - Monitor memory and CPU usage to avoid throttling.  
  - Test functions under load to ensure scalability.
- **API Gateway Limits:**  
  - Familiarize yourself with API Gateway's rate limits and payload size restrictions.

## 3. AI Implementation: AWS Bedrock

### Best Practices
- **Integration:**  
  - Use AWS Bedrock's managed services to integrate AI models seamlessly.  
  - Ensure robust error handling and fallback mechanisms when calling AI APIs.
- **Model Selection:**  
  - Choose models that best fit the specific content strategy and data analysis requirements.
- **Data Security:**  
  - Ensure data passed to AI services is properly sanitized and secured.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Monitor API usage and performance through AWS CloudWatch or similar tools.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Cost Considerations:**  
  - Monitor costs closely, as AI service usage can become expensive with high volume.
- **Latency:**  
  - Account for potential latency when making AI API calls; design asynchronous workflows where possible.
- **Versioning:**  
  - Keep track of model versions and updates to avoid unexpected behavior when models are updated by AWS.

## 4. Databases & Data Storage: AWS DynamoDB

### Best Practices
- **Data Modeling:**  
  - Design your tables with access patterns in mind; use partition keys and secondary indexes appropriately.
  - Consider data denormalization to optimize query performance.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Use on-demand capacity or provisioned capacity with auto-scaling as required.
- **Security:**  
  - Implement fine-grained access control using IAM policies.
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  - Use DynamoDB backups and enable point-in-time recovery to safeguard data.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Query Limitations:**  
  - Understand that DynamoDB is not optimized for complex queries (joins, aggregations).  
  - Use AWS Lambda functions or additional processing for complex data transformations.
- **Cost Management:**  
  - Monitor read/write capacity usage and adjust settings to avoid cost overruns.
- **Consistency:**  
  - Be mindful of eventual consistency in read operations; use strongly consistent reads where necessary.

## 5. DevOps & CI/CD: AWS Amplify

### Best Practices
- **Integrated Workflow:**  
  - Use Amplify's CLI and console for streamlined deployments across frontend and backend.
  - Set up environments for development, staging, and production.
- **Automated Testing & Builds:**  
  - Integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline.
  - Use version control branching strategies to manage deployments.
- **Monitoring & Rollbacks:**  
  - Monitor deployments for errors and set up automatic rollback strategies.
- **Configuration Management:**  
  - Securely manage environment variables and secrets through AWS Secrets Manager or Amplify's configuration.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Vendor Lock-In:**  
  - Be aware of the deep AWS integration, which might complicate migrations to other platforms.
- **Complexity:**  
  - While Amplify simplifies many tasks, it can abstract away details that may need customization later.
- **Deployment Delays:**  
  - Large projects might experience longer deployment times; plan for staging and testing cycles accordingly.

## 6. Authentication: Auth0

### Best Practices
- **User Management:**  
  - Use Auth0 for handling user sign-up, sign-in, and multi-factor authentication.
  - Leverage Auth0's built-in support for social identity providers if needed.
- **Security:**  
  - Configure strong password policies and secure token storage.
  - Use Auth0 Rules and Actions for custom authentication flows or validation.
- **Integration:**  
  - Integrate with React using the Auth0 React SDK for seamless front-end authentication management.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Complexity in Customization:**  
  - Advanced customization of Auth0 workflows may require understanding of Auth0 Rules, Actions, and Hooks.
- **Token Management:**  
  - Ensure proper management of tokens and handle token expiration gracefully on the client side.
- **Cost Considerations:**  
  - Monitor usage as Auth0 pricing is based on active users and may increase with scale.

## 7. UI Components & Styling: Bootstrap (via React-Bootstrap)

### Best Practices
- **Component Consistency:**  
  - Use React-Bootstrap components to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
  - Follow Bootstrap’s grid system and component classes for responsive design.
- **Integration with React:**  
  - Ensure that components are used in a way that respects React’s component lifecycle and state management.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Utilize Bootstrap’s built-in accessibility features, and test components to ensure they meet accessibility standards.

### Limitations & Pitfalls
- **Design Constraints:**  
  - Bootstrap’s default styling may feel generic; customization is key to maintaining a unique brand identity.
- **Overhead:**  
  - Avoid importing the entire Bootstrap library if only a subset of components is needed; consider tree-shaking or custom builds.
- **Component Conflicts:**  
  - Ensure that any additional custom styles do not conflict with Bootstrap’s core styles.
- **Calendar Component Integration:**  
  - When integrating third-party calendar components, ensure that their styling can be harmonized with Bootstrap’s theme.
