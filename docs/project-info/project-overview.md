# Project Overview

An AI-powered content strategist that automates the analysis of existing content and generates a detailed, calendar-based strategy with multi-format recommendations and SEO refresh suggestions. In essence, the project aims to:

## Purpose

Empower marketing leaders by transforming labor-intensive content audits into actionable, data-driven content calendars. The AI agent will help identify gaps, optimize current assets, and recommend diverse content formats that align with both audience interests and SEO best practices.

## Scope

- Content Ingestion & Analysis: Users input a list of public URLs, which the system scrapes to extract text, metadata, and any available performance insights.
- Strategy Generation: The system produces a visual, calendar-based content plan (3-6 months out) that includes content titles, formats (e.g., infographics, videos, podcasts), and publication dates.
- Optimization & Refresh: It also identifies underperforming or outdated content and offers tailored refresh recommendations (including SEO improvements).

## Goals    

- Reduce Manual Effort: Automate the heavy lifting in content audits and strategy planning, saving significant time for marketing teams.
- Increase ROI: Ensure every piece of content is tied to measurable marketing outcomes, whether through improved SEO, engagement, or lead generation.
- Enhance User Experience: Provide an intuitive UI that is accessible even for non-technical users, complete with tutorials and tooltips.
