# Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication

This phase focuses on establishing the project foundation and implementing user authentication using AWS Cognito. This will create the base structure for our application and enable secure user access.

## 1. Project Initialization

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Create React application with TypeScript
- [ ] Set up folder structure according to codebase best practices
- [ ] Configure React Router DOM for navigation
- [ ] Install and configure React-Bootstrap
- [ ] Set up CSS structure for Bootstrap customization (no SASS)
- [ ] Create basic theme variables based on Theme Guidelines
- [ ] Configure AWS Amplify library for frontend
- [ ] Set up testing environment (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Create placeholder components for main pages

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Initialize AWS Amplify project
- [ ] Configure AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- [ ] Set up infrastructure as code templates
- [ ] Create basic CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Configure environment variables and secrets management

## 2. Authentication System

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Create AuthPage component with login/signup forms
- [ ] Implement form validation for authentication inputs
- [ ] Style authentication forms using React-Bootstrap
- [ ] Create authentication context/provider for state management
- [ ] Implement protected routes using React Router DOM
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling for auth operations
- [ ] Create user profile dropdown in navigation
- [ ] Implement logout functionality
- [ ] Add "Forgot Password" flow
- [ ] Create unit tests for authentication components

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Configure AWS Cognito User Pool
- [ ] Set up authentication triggers in Lambda (if needed)
- [ ] Configure identity providers (if supporting social login)
- [ ] Implement user attributes and groups
- [ ] Set up authentication API endpoints
- [ ] Configure security policies and access controls
- [ ] Test authentication flows end-to-end

## 3. Main Navigation & Layout

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Create main layout component with responsive design
- [ ] Implement navigation bar with authentication state awareness
- [ ] Create sidebar for main navigation items
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet views
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs for navigation hierarchy
- [ ] Create loading indicators and error boundaries
- [ ] Implement basic dashboard layout
- [ ] Style all navigation components according to theme guidelines
- [ ] Add animations for transitions between pages
- [ ] Create unit tests for layout components

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Create API endpoints for user preferences
- [ ] Implement user settings storage in DynamoDB
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch for monitoring application performance

## 4. User Onboarding

### Frontend Tasks
- [ ] Create onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] Implement step-by-step tutorial components
- [ ] Add tooltips for key features
- [ ] Create help/documentation section
- [ ] Implement user preference settings
- [ ] Add welcome dashboard for first-time users
- [ ] Create unit tests for onboarding components

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Create API for storing onboarding progress
- [ ] Implement user preference storage
- [ ] Set up analytics for onboarding completion rates

## Definition of Done
- All users can securely register, login, and manage their accounts
- Main application layout and navigation is complete and responsive
- New users receive appropriate onboarding guidance
- All components follow the established design system
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code
- CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys the application
