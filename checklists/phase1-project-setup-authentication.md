# Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication

This phase focuses on establishing the project foundation and implementing user authentication using Auth0. This will create the base structure for our application and enable secure user access.

## 1. Project Initialization

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Create React application with TypeScript
- [x] Set up folder structure according to codebase best practices
- [x] Configure React Router DOM for navigation
- [x] Install and configure React-Bootstrap
- [x] Set up CSS structure for Bootstrap customization (no SASS)
- [x] Create basic theme variables based on Theme Guidelines
- [x] Configure AWS Amplify library for frontend
- [x] Set up testing environment (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [x] Create placeholder components for main pages

### Backend Tasks
- [x] Initialize AWS Amplify project
- [x] Configure AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB)
- [x] Set up infrastructure as code templates
- [x] Create basic CI/CD pipeline configuration

## 2. Authentication System

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Create AuthPage component with login/signup forms
- [x] Implement form validation for authentication inputs
- [x] Style authentication forms using React-Bootstrap
- [x] Create authentication context/provider for state management
- [x] Implement protected routes using React Router DOM
- [x] Add loading states and error handling for auth operations
- [x] Create user profile dropdown in navigation
- [x] Implement logout functionality
- [x] Add "Forgot Password" flow (included with Auth0)
- [x] Create unit tests for authentication components

### Backend Tasks
- [x] Set up Auth0 Rules for custom claims (if needed)
- [x] Configure social identity providers (if supporting social login)
- [x] Implement user metadata and roles in Auth0
- [x] Set up authentication API endpoints
- [x] Configure security policies and access controls
- [x] Test authentication flows end-to-end

## 3. Main Navigation & Layout

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Create main layout component with responsive design
- [x] Implement navigation bar with authentication state awareness
- [x] Create sidebar for main navigation items
- [x] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet views
- [x] Add breadcrumbs for navigation hierarchy (intentionally skipped - app-like experience)
- [x] Create loading indicators and error boundaries
- [x] Implement basic dashboard layout
- [x] Style all navigation components according to theme guidelines
- [x] Add animations for transitions between pages
- [x] Create unit tests for layout components

### Backend Tasks
- [x] Create API endpoints for user preferences
- [x] Implement user settings storage in DynamoDB

## 4. User Onboarding

### Frontend Tasks
- [x] Create onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] Implement step-by-step tutorial components
- [ ] Add tooltips for key features
- [ ] Create help/documentation section
- [x] Implement user preference settings
- [x] Add welcome dashboard for first-time users
- [ ] Create unit tests for onboarding components

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Create API for storing onboarding progress
- [x] Implement user preference storage
- [ ] Set up analytics for onboarding completion rates

## Definition of Done
- All users can securely register, login, and manage their accounts
- Main application layout and navigation is complete and responsive
- New users receive appropriate onboarding guidance
- All components follow the established design system
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code
- CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys the application
