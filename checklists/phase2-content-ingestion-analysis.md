- [ ] Create performance monitoring for dashboard queries

## Definition of Done
- Users can submit individual or batches of URLs for analysis
- Content is successfully scraped and stored from submitted URLs
- AI analysis is performed on extracted content
- Users can view, search, and filter analyzed content
- All components follow the established design system
- Unit tests cover at least 80% of the code
- System handles errors gracefully with appropriate user feedback
